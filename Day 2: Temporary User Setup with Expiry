/* Day 2: Temporary User Setup with Expiry
As part of the temporary assignment to the Nautilus project, a developer named anita requires access for a limited duration. To ensure smooth access management, a temporary user account with an expiry date is needed. Here's what you need to do:
Create a user named anita on App Server 3 in Stratos Datacenter. Set the expiry date to 2024-04-15, ensuring the user is created in lowercase as per standard protocol.
Note: You can find the infrastructure details by clicking on the Details of all Users and Servers button on the top-right section of the page. */

ssh banner@stapp03.stratos.xfusioncorp.com
sudo useradd anita
sudo chage -E 2024-04-15 anita
