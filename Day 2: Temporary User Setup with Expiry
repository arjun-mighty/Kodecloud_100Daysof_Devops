/* Day 2: Temporary User Setup with Expiry
As part of the temporary assignment to the Nautilus project, a developer named anita requires access for a limited duration. To ensure smooth access management, a temporary user account with an expiry date is needed. Here's what you need to do:
Create a user named anita on App Server 3 in Stratos Datacenter. Set the expiry date to 2024-04-15, ensuring the user is created in lowercase as per standard protocol.
Note: You can find the infrastructure details by clicking on the Details of all Users and Servers button on the top-right section of the page. */

//Solution

ssh banner@stapp03.stratos.xfusioncorp.com
sudo useradd anita
sudo chage -E 2024-04-15 anita


/* 3.task Group Creation and User Assignment

The system admin team at xFusionCorp Industries has streamlined access management by implementing group-based access control. Here's what you need to do:
a. Create a group named nautilus_noc across all App servers within the Stratos Datacenter.
b. Add the user stark into the nautilus_noc group on all App servers. If the user doesn't exist, create it as well.
Note: You can find the infrastructure details by clicking on the Details of all Users and Servers button on the top-right section of the page. */

Solution

ssh tony@stapp01.stratos.xfusioncorp.com
sudo groupadd -f nautilus_noc
id -u stark || sudo useradd stark
sudo usermod -aG nautilus_noc stark

/*Since there are 3 App servers (stapp01, stapp02, and stapp03), you need to run the commands 3 times in total—once on each server.*/
