// Day 3: Secure Root SSH Access

Following security audits, the xFusionCorp Industries security team has rolled out new protocols, including the restriction of direct root SSH login.


Your task is to disable direct SSH root login on all app servers within the Stratos Datacenter.

Solution 

To disable direct SSH root login for all app servers in the Stratos Datacenter, update the SSH configuration on each server so that the root account cannot access the system via SSH.

Steps to Disable Direct Root SSH Login
Log in to each app server with its respective non-root admin account:

stapp01: tony

stapp02: steve

stapp03: banner

Edit the SSH configuration file using a text editor, e.g., vim or nano:

Command: sudo vi /etc/ssh/sshd_config

Locate the line PermitRootLogin yes. If the line is commented (#PermitRootLogin yes), uncomment and change it to PermitRootLogin no.

Save and close the configuration file.

Restart the SSH service for changes to take effect:

sudo systemctl restart sshd

You may also check its status: sudo systemctl status sshd

Impact and Rationale
Disabling direct root login closes a major security vulnerability and reduces the risk of brute-force attacks.

Administrators should log in using their own accounts and then escalate privileges with sudo as needed, maintaining accountability and better audit trails.

These changes must be applied to every app server to meet xFusionCorp Industriesâ€™ new protocols and secure the Stratos Datacenter against unauthorized root access.




example : 1 
ssh tony@stapp01
sudo vi /etc/ssh/sshd_config
# Disable direct SSH root login for security compliance
PermitRootLogin no
sudo systemctl restart sshd
sudo systemctl status sshd


Like that we need to do for all 3 users
